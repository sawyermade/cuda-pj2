For project 2 I used Algorithm 3 from the Efficient 2-Body Statistics Computation on GPUs:Parallelization & Beyond paper. The techniques used in the algorithm are a combination of tiling the input and privatization of the output. I also leave the anchor block L in the register. The first step is to load the atoms in parallel to a local register variable: "atom L = d_histogram[threadIdx.x + blockDim.x*blockIdx.x]" while also initializing the shared histogram to 0 in the same parallel manner. The initialization for loop jumps by block dimension, so if the number of buckets < threads/block then it will only run once.
